| Fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 | Supervised Learning, Transfer Learning |  Using pre-trained Speech Models can alleviate the time and data requirement to train an ASR system, while still performing near state of the art. This tutorial uses HuggingFace's Transformers library to streamline creating these models.                          |  [Fine-tuning for English Systems](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/Fine_tuning_Wav2Vec2_for_English_ASR.ipynb) [Fine-tuning for non-English Systems](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/Fine_Tune_XLSR_Wav2Vec2_on_Turkish_ASR_with_%F0%9F%A4%97_Transformers.ipynb)     |
| ESPnet Speech toolkit | Supervised Learning |  ESPnet is an End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit, similar to the Kaldi ASR toolkit, but using purely deep neural nets for models. It is a flexible system, however, many high power recipes provided might be very resources (GPU/RAM) and time demanding.
