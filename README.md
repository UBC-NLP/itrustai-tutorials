# General Instructions

For each task, we want to do the following in a notebook.

- what is it?
- a small dataset
- an example tutorial, possibly just using an off-the-shelf tool (classical ML)
- a deep learning example
- list of external tools, possibly with some brief explanation about each tool (a couple of sentences, what it does, why good/bad, what languages it covers)

## Natural Language Processing

Muhammad writes some content here (Peter)...


For POS and NER:

- explain what each is
- provide a sample dataset (small, in English)
- show how to train a model with deep learning (one with BiLSTM using PyTorch, and another with fine-tuning BERT use HuggingFace)
- list existing tools and explain how to use Spacy

### POS Tagging (Ife)


### NER (Weirui)


### Text Classification (Chiyu)

- What is text classification?

#### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
##### What is ASR
ASR is the task of taking speech audio files and automatically creating transcriptions for the audio.

| Fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 | Supervised Learning, Transfer Learning |  Using pre-trained Speech Models can alleviate the time and data requirement to train an ASR system, while still performing near state of the art. This tutorial uses HuggingFace's Transformers library to streamline creating these models.                          |  [Fine-tuning for English Systems](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/Fine_tuning_Wav2Vec2_for_English_ASR.ipynb) [Fine-tuning for non-English Systems](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/Fine_Tune_XLSR_Wav2Vec2_on_Turkish_ASR_with_%F0%9F%A4%97_Transformers.ipynb)     |
| ESPnet Speech toolkit | Supervised Learning |  ESPnet is an End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit, similar to the Kaldi ASR toolkit, but using purely deep neural nets for models. It is a flexible system, however, many high power recipes provided might be very resources (GPU/RAM) and time demanding. Supports ASR, Speech Translation, Text-to-Speech and more                         |   [Github](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) and [ASR example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/espnet/notebook/blob/master/espnet2_asr_realtime_demo.ipynb) [Note: ESPnet2 underdevelopment]   |
